# Calm.me Rest API - WIP

In this simple example I am creating a RESTful API on JAVA. It will follow the MVC Principles and I will use an In Memory Database to provide a login system for users using the app. The application's GitHub repo that is using this back-end can be found [here](https://github.com/lakylekidd/calm-me-app).
